* Improve card matching using said metadata: Name, CMC, Type, Text, Power, Toughness
* Allow multiple decks/tests saved
* Add more pre-made decks/tests samples
* Add how-to-use
* Change to react-bootstrap for visually pleasing components (Panel for the tests, better buttons, alert, menu, glyphicons)
